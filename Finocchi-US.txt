US1:
    As an external user,
    I want to search for subjects' categories,
    So that I can look for the notes I'm interested in.
    
US2:
    As a student user,
    I want to public my notes as private or public,
    So that other students can see only the notes I set as public.
    
US3:
    As a professor user,
    I want to permit students to subscribe to my course,
    So that they can receive push notifications whenever I public notes.
